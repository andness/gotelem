# Gotelem - A very simple Go telemetry package #

Gotelem offers a very simple model for exposing telemetry data from
your Go code. Create observers or counters and add sliding window
summarizers like the 5 minute moving average. The data can easily be
exposed as JSON over HTTP.

I pronounce the name "Go Tell'Em".
